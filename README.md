## A Re-Introduction to your Computer

‚Äî A pre-introduction to computing

Coding isn‚Äôt something that just happens in your text editor or terminal. Coding can be a wholistic computer practice, a new relationship you have with your computer & your computer habits. from the way you name your files or organize your folders, to completely changing how you perform routine tasks on your computer such as moving a file.

    - Coding can be a revelatory computer practice, a new relationship you have with your computer & your computer habits. from the way you name your files or organize your folders, to completely changing how you perform routine tasks on your computer such as moving a file.
- Note about Melanie‚Äôs programming teaching style
    - Feel free to ask questions during class or ask your neighbor if they might be able to point you in the right direction
- Make sure anything you create in class today is something you would be comfortable sharing in class / existing online publicly

- Use Spotlight: Command, space, spotlight search pulled up, type in folder name: design2b
- Command, tab- switches between most recent applications that you already have opened with ease.

Note- Folder names and file names should be written in lowercase and without any spaces.

Cmd + S = save

Cmd + Ctrl + spacebar = emojis!!!

# Command line

- Everyone receives a folder and puts it in their **home** directory
    - What is this folder and how will we use it throughout the whole session?
    - What is the home directory?
- Terminal - what is it?
    - It is a way to get text based access to your operating system
    - How to get to it?
1. Type Cmd + Spacebar to open Quickfinder
2. type ‚Äòterminal‚Äô
- Bash - what is it?
    - bash is the programming language that we use in the terminal, often one line at a time, but we can also put bash code in a file and run that file

    - The house as an example folder structure narrative because using the command line is a relational practice. You are never using the command line from a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù perspective. When you issue commands from the command line, you are doing so, from a particular position within the hierarchy of your computer‚Äôs file system.
        - Similarly, when we are inside a house, we are never simultaneously in the kitchen and the bedroom. If we tried to ‚Äúget into bed‚Äù while in the kitchen, we would not be able to. However if we wanted to wash dishes while standing in the kitchen, we would be able to.
        - From the command line, if we have navigated to the Desktop folder but try to perform an action on a file that‚Äôs inside your home directory, this would not work. You would have to navigate to the home directory by navigating your file path.
