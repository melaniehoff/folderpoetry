 ## Disclamier
This workshop assumes no coding experience and simultaneously takes the position that everyone who interacts with computers in some way is already a programmer.

### Coding isn‚Äôt something that just happens behind your screen. 
Coding _can be_ a holistic computer practice, a new relationship you have with your computer & your computers habits - from the way you name your files or organize your folders, to completely changing how you perform routine tasks on your computer, such as moving a file.

## Vocabulary
**Word** | **Definition**
--- | ---
folder | (also referred to as directory) is an organizational regime imposed on your computer used to store and organize files and other folders
file | is an object on a computer which stores data, information, settings, or commands to be used with various computer programs
file types/formats/extensions | indicate how data has been stored and how to read or open files in specific programs. for example, `.txt` files open in a text editor, `.jpg` files open in an image viewer/editor. full list of file formats and extensions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats)
file path | tells you the location of a file in a system. for example `users/username/desktop/folder_poetry_club`
terminal | is a way to get text based access to your operating system
terminal commands | give you the ability to control your computer using command prompts. for example, terminal commands on mac computers are written in a language called bash
bash | is the programming language we use in the terminal, often one line at a time, but we can also put bash code in a file and run that file

## File organization
- Naming files and folders
    - All lowercase
    - No spaces, under scores and dashes are ok (for example, `my_folder` or `my-folder`)
- File types
    - `.txt`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`
- Mind your file path
    - `/../../../../../`

Terminal is a way to get root level, text based access to your operating system. 

**How do you access it?**
- Type `command + spacebar` to open search
- Type 'terminal' into the search field to open the application

### Bash

### Alias to put in bash_profile

An alias (shortcut) to put in your .bash_profile for viewing folder tree structure:

```alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|;g;s;|; |;g'"```

An alias to put in your .bash_profile to automatically run an emoji for loop:

```alias folderpoetry="for i in {1..2000}; do printf ' ‚ô° üìÇ ‚Üí ‚û© ‚û™ ‚û´ ‚û¨ ‚û≠ ‚ûÆ '; done;"``` 

## Folder Poetry Activity
### Download the house
Download the [house](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19U9G9hNCWdiwFbkfna20nlhDOoB8uHHg) folder and put it in your computer's home folder. Your home folder or directory on a mac is represented by a house icon üè† in finder and by the `~` symbol in terminal. This folder is located near the root of your computer's entire system. Explore the house.

### What is the house?
The house as an example folder structure poem because **using the command line and computing in general is a relational practice**. You are never using the command line from a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù perspective. When you issue commands from the command line, you are doing so, from a particular position within the hierarchy of your computer‚Äôs file system.

Similarly, when we are inside a house, we are never simultaneously in the kitchen and the bedroom. If we tried to ‚Äúget into bed‚Äù while in the kitchen, we would not be able to. However if we wanted to wash dishes while standing in the kitchen, we would be able to.

From the command line, if we have navigated to the Desktop folder but try to perform an action on a file that‚Äôs inside your home directory, this would not work. You would have to navigate to the home folder by navigating your file path.

### Make your own file path or file tree
1. After exploring the house together, consider what other narratives you would like to explore with folder structures.
Using the worksheet template or a blank piece of paper in the [zine](assets/pdf/folder_poetry_zine_pages.pdf), take a few minutes to come up with some ideas that are meaningful or interesting to you. For example, [a folder of one's own](http://folderpoetry.club/a/folder/of/ones/own/) and [my fears](http://folderpoetry.club/my-fears/).
2. Share with a partner
3. Using terminal alone, create the folders and files that make up your folder poem
    - Your files can be `.txt`, `.html`, or `.sh`
    - The contents of your files can be words, ideas, thoughts, feelings, emojis, or bash scripts
    - To include emoji icons in your poems, the file must be a `.html` file with the following line included at the top: `<meta charset="utf-8" />`
4. Upload your folder to: [Folder Poetry Club](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U8IcCOcDpxOcaweu5qovpnPAM1KQU8VN?usp=sharing) üìÇ 
5. Soon, you should see your folder poem live on [folderpoetry.club](folderpoetry.club)
