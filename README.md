### Coding isn’t something that just happens behind your screen. Coding _can be_ a holistic computer practice, a new relationship you have with your computer & your computer habits. from the way you name your files or organize your folders, to completely changing how you perform routine tasks on your computer such as moving a file.


### This workshop assumes no coding experience and simultaneously takes the position that everyone who interacts with computers in some way is already a programmer.

**Agenda**
- Intros: What is the story

- Longer Intros
- History of SFPC
- A reintroduction to computers & computing
    - Folder/File systems

## Handy Shortcuts to Sharpen Computer Habits

| Keyboard Shortcuts for Mac | Description                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| cmd + Tab                  | Switch between applications |
| Cmd + Spacebar             | Spotlight search            |

# Command line

## Download this folder named [house](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19U9G9hNCWdiwFbkfna20nlhDOoB8uHHg) and put it in your computer's home folder 

- Everyone receives a folder and puts it in their **home** directory
    - your home directory on a Mac is represented with a house icon in fnder and by the ~ symbol in terminal. It is a folder that is located near the root of your computer's entire system.
    
### Terminal
    - It is a way to get text based access to your operating system
    - How to get to it?
        - Type Cmd + Spacebar to open Quickfinder
        - type ‘terminal’
### Bash
    - bash is the programming language that we use in the terminal, often one line at a time, but we can also put bash code in a file and run that file


The house as an example folder structure poem because **using the command line and computing in general is a relational practice**. You are never using the command line from a “global” perspective. When you issue commands from the command line, you are doing so, from a particular position within the hierarchy of your computer’s file system.

Similarly, when we are inside a house, we are never simultaneously in the kitchen and the bedroom. If we tried to “get into bed” while in the kitchen, we would not be able to. However if we wanted to wash dishes while standing in the kitchen, we would be able to.
From the command line, if we have navigated to the Desktop folder but try to perform an action on a file that’s inside your home directory, this would not work. You would have to navigate to the home directory by navigating your file path.

# Folder Poetry Activity

1. After exploring the house together, consider what other narratives you would like to explore with folder structures?
Using the worksheet template or a blank piece of paper, take a few minutes to come up with some ideas that are meaningful or interesting to you. 

Example:
- Fears
- little-buddies

2. Share with a partner


3. Using terminal alone, create the folders and files that make up your folder poem

    - Your files can be .txt, .html, or .sh
    - inside them can be words, ideas, thoughts, feelings, emojis, or bash scripts
    - to include emoji in your poems, the file must be a .html file with this line included at the top: `<meta charset="utf-8" />`

4. Upload your folder to:
#### 📂📂📂 [Folder Poetry Club](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U8IcCOcDpxOcaweu5qovpnPAM1KQU8VN?usp=sharing)

5. Soon, you should see your folder poem live on [folderpoetry.club](folderpoetry.club)

6. Club sharing!
